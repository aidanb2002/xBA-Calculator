# xBA-Calculator

Created an R Shiny App that allows the input of an exit velocity and launch angle that produces the expected batting average for that pair. Data was taken from the 2020 season up until about half of the 2023 season. Data can be taken back from 2015 to ensure optimal accuracy. Something fun as personal use that I thought would be interesting while watching baseball games to add context to the batted balls.
